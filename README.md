# Titanic-Kaggle-Project
Machine learning project based on Titanic dataset from Kaggle

# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster 🚢

This is a beginner-level machine learning project based on the **Kaggle Titanic dataset**. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using features like age, sex, ticket class, etc.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `ML_mini_project.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with all preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `.gitignore` – Hides temporary and checkpoint files from Git tracking.

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the **Kaggle Titanic dataset**:
- [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vamsi-karri/Titanic-Kaggle-Project.git
    cd Titanic-Kaggle-Project
    ```

2. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook ML_mini_project.ipynb
    ```

3. Make sure you have all the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run all the cells to execute the full pipeline.

## 📈 Model Performance

- Accuracy: ~80–85% on training data
- Accuracy: ~70–80% on test data
- Models used: Random Forest Classifier
